subtitle: B. Sc. Human Computer Interaction
---

My name is Lena Hinzer. I have a Bachelor's in Human-Computer Interaction at JMU WÃ¼rzburg.

Because of the rapid rise of technology in society, I started to study Human Computer Interaction to help more people use technology in their daily lives. While doing a volunteer year working with the elderly and mentally ill, I tried bringing them closer to technology. For this I organized a course teaching them about the use of computers. There I noticed that understanding of technology is still a very complicated issue for many people. Since then I am especially interested in the topics of Accessibility, Consumer Electronics and User Centered Design.
